Hm-mm, yeah, yeah
Got me wide, wide open,
got a .45 on him
And he pushing 'bout a 102
Always smokin' somethin',
he ain't worried 'bout nothin'
'Cause he ain't got
nothing to lose
I got a thing
for the hard liquor on ice
Short days and long nights
Marlboros out the window
Middle finger to the sky
Say you wanna get dangerous
Now you're speaking my language
I forgot what your name is
So, I'ma call you mine,
I'ma call you mine
Got me wide, wide open,
got a .45 on him
And he pushing 'bout a 102
Always smokin' somethin',
he ain't worried 'bout nothin'
'Cause he ain't got
nothing to lose
I got a thing for the wild ones
(Wild, wild, wild)
I got a thing for the wild ones,
it's like he knew
I got a thing for the wild ones
(Wild, wild, wild)
I got a thing for the wild ones,
they like me too
(Yeah) I'm attracted to things
that are really crazy
Asking me how I've been
feeling lately
Coming for mine,
then it's do or die
I won't let it slide,
no stealing bases
No back-and-forth bargaining
(Now)
No bitchin' and arguing
A whole lotta problems,
living in Gotham
And Bunnie's my Harley Quinn
(My Harley Quinn)
Was raised in the darkness,
forgive me, I'm guarded
(Guarded)
I have no shame,
I'm in love with the heartless
The police will never take us
alive and cowgirls don't cry
Got me wide, wide open,
got a .45 on him
And he pushing 'bout a 102
Always smokin' somethin',
he ain't worried 'bout nothin'
'Cause he ain't got
nothing to lose
I got a thing for the wild ones
(Wild, wild, wild)
I got a thing for the wild ones,
it's like he knew
I got a thing for the wild ones
(Wild, wild, wild)
I got a thing for the wild ones,
they like me too
Yeah (Wild, wild, wild)
A thing for the wild ones
(It's like he knew)
I got a thing for the wild ones
(Wild, wild, wild)
Got a thing for the wild ones
(They like me too, hm)
