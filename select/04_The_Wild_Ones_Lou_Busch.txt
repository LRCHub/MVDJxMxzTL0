The Wild Ones
There's a song playing on the radio
Sky high in the airwaves
On the morning show
And there's a lifeline slipping
As the record plays
And as I open the blinds in my mind
I'm believing that you could stay
And oh if you stay
I'll chase the rainblown fields away
We'll shine like the morning and sin in the sun
Oh if you stay
We'll be the wild ones,
Running with the dogs today
There's a song playing through another wall
All we see and believe
Is the D.J. and debts dissolve
And it's a shame the plane is leaving
On this sunny day
Cos on you my tattoo will be bleeding
And the name will stain
But oh if you stay
We'll ride from disguised suburban graves
We'll go from the bungalows
Where the debts still grow every day
And oh if you stay
I'll chase the rainblown fears away
We'll shine like the morning
And sin in the sun oh if you stay
We'll be the wild ones
Running with the dogs today
We'll be the wild ones
Running with the dogs today
Running with the dogs today
